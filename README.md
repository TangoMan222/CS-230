Questions:

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The client was the Gaming Room and they wanted a web-based game that can run on several platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I believe that I described the requirements as well as the advantages and disadvantages to using these new platforms.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  The design document layed a great foundation for the code and helped to give direction when questions arose.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I feel the layout of the document itself could be revised to aleviate redundant repetition.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  It is important to comply with the users needs because they are the end user and pay for your product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I like to use a list that to organize the requirements so I can approach them one by one.
